<h2>Setting Goals</h2>
<p>
  Set specific goals by week and by day. Weekly goals should be set Sunday night when scheduling plans for the week. Daily goals for each part of schedule like code/reading etc. should be made the day before as you wrap up work for that day. Having goals set out for you in advance increases the chances that you'll actually complete these goals.
