<h2>Setting Goals</h2>
<p>
  Set specific goals by week and by day. Weekly goals should be set Sunday night when scheduling plans for the week. Daily goals for each part of schedule like code/reading etc. should be made the day before as you wrap up work for that day. Having goals set out for you in advance increases the chances that you'll actually complete these goals.
</p>

<h2>Weekly Goals</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Grocery Store - Monday</li>
  <li>Clean Apartment - Friday </li>
  <li>Gym - Every Tuesday & Thursday</li>
  <li>Write a blog post - By EOD Friday</li>
</ul>

<h2>Daily Schedule</h2>
<p>
  This is the general schedule I will try to stick to during the week.
</p>

<ul>
  <li> 7-8 AM - Wake up</li>
  <li>8 - 8:30 - Yoga </li>
  <li>8:30 - 9 - Breakfast</li>
  <li>9 - 10 - Code</li>
  <li>10-12 - Watch TV fun/you time & Lunch</li>
  <li>12-1:30 - Gym or Reading Depending on Day of week</li>
  <li>2-5 - Job search, erands, more code, work on blog posts</li>
  <li>5 - Midnight - Meetups, You Time, Cook a great dinner</li>
</ul>

<h2>Learning</h2>
<p>Good learning resources I stumbled across during & after Turing. Mostly technical, but some that are not.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Exercisms</li>

  My recommendation would be to find blogs to follow/people on Medium that are doing something cool that you'd like to hear more about.
